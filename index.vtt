00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:08.435
[audio playing...]

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.460
I call what I do cultural activism. I

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.380
founded spirit fest as a way to say

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.020
something loudly together about human

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.560
rights, LGBTQ plus rights, feminism and

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.895
inclusion, using arts in public spaces

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.475
to raise civic awareness,

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.600
asking how can we claim our rights to

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.485
live in the city and to change it?

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.630
Of course. Now we claim our rights to

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.210
our cities in a different way with the

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.585
weapons

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.350
as the artists and journalists lft

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.725
national Csaba doesn't make a story,

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.820
which reminds me of before the full

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.070
scale invasion, the many people

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.560
protested, found in Mariupol to speak

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.950
loudly that his flowers bloomed. We were

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:54.900
planning and dreaming to make this choir

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.995
of cultural interventions.

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.840
As a listen to Elif Tina, a question how

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.700
is it possible to explain all of this to

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.055
you?

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.640
How could I describe this huge

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.040
chandelier with Hannah from the ceiling

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.955
of marucho drama theater.

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:12.630
And what's happened to its Christos when

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.030
the rocket hit the theater, because it

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.710
must be too big to have completely

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.965
disappeared.

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.090
And it's important to speak a fascist

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.310
from the chandelier when hundreds of

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:31.595
people were killed in the theater.

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.380
I was born and lived in Mariupol all my

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.340
life. I loved it very much. I'm from a

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.520
factory workers dynasty. But I dreamt of

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.045
being a journalist.

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.030
In 2014, when everything started, my son

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.015
was born.

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.550
He was my universe. So despite all of

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.430
this crucial situations, I was

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.795
concentrating on being a mother.

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.770
Then the Russians shelled Mariupol in

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.035
2015. And it was a huge shock.

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.255
A lot of people died. A lot of kids

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.220
and from that moment, we understood what

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.835
war is.

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.025
It was very scary.

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.030
And it mobilized people because we were

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.300
afraid to be occupied. I decided to

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.140
become a journalist to work on TV, and

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.025
to challenge the Russian propaganda that

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.790
Mario police Russian city with the

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.285
Russian culture, showing instead,

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.810
Ukrainian artists forwards Fine Arts. A

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.750
lot of art festivals, cultural events

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.380
and exhibitions became inspired in this

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.975
period and appeared in the city.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.510
He was like fresh water that clenched a

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.560
dry throat. A synergy of artists, local

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.685
people and audiences

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:04.080
are art became united with this

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.100
industrial landscape like flowers that

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:13.505
grew from the concrete.

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.470
Donetsk was occupied and on the road

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.870
there for more Upul, a performance

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.875
called The Way Home was created.

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.580
It ended on the bridge with the

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.580
resurrection of a huge iron sculpture,

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:35.015
symbolizing the tree of life.

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.310
When the full scale invasion began, we

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.290
thought we already knew what troubles

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.200
were. But we did not imagine how

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.945
merciless Russians can be.

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.340
From the beginning, a lot of people lost

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.315
their homes because of shelling.

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.215
There was no water, no food,

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.615
no electricity,

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:05.135
no internet or mobile connection.

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.200
Mariupol drama theater became a

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:12.065
humanitarian and informational point.

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.430
By March, it was already impossible to

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.190
leave the city. And there were rumors

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.320
that there would be an evacuation from

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.395
the theater.

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:25.110
Me and my son went every day. But the

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:26.730
evacuation never happened.

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.330
On the 16th of March, I was at home

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.670
preparing to sleep in the courtyard with

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.735
our neighbors from our building.

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.190
This was the only way we could cook and

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.715
everyone was hungry.

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:42.750
I came up to the apartment with the kids

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.940
to eat. And then there was a huge

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.015
explosion.

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.800
The bomb had landed in the courtyard and

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.960
we could not see anything because dust

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:56.885
was everywhere.

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:59.370
My brother took the smaller kids and

00:04:59.400 --> 00:04:59.970
adults big

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.914
In two days

00:05:02.939 --> 00:05:05.069
we found our neighbor's bodies under the

00:05:05.069 --> 00:05:08.375
rubble.

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.585
After that, we understood that no one

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:16.385
and nothing was serious.

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:19.020
We decided to walk buy food from Marine

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:21.275
LePen.

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.300
As we fled, we could see the fire from

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.280
the explosion of the marine fuel drama

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.025
theater.

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:30.360
It was the same plane that dropped the

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:34.655
bomb on my home.

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.860
The whole city was on fire with clouds

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:39.870
of smoke, so we didn't know the measure

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:42.330
of the tragedy that took place in the

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:45.575
theater.

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.940
Later, we heard that hundreds of people

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:50.555
lay in the ashes.

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:52.745
It was a big shock.

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:55.680
It was clearly marked as a theatre. And

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:58.230
they were huge letters written outside

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:04.565
on the ground, saying children

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:07.505
when the Russians occupied the city,

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:10.260
they didn't take the bodies from under

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.955
the ruins of the theater.

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:15.900
So no one knows the exact number of

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:21.965
people that died in this tragedy.

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:24.720
They took all ashes and transported them

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:27.360
somewhere, dropping them just like

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:30.785
trash.

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:33.815
And then they made the surface concrete

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:36.780
and began to use the space for contents.

00:06:36.805 --> 00:07:05.523
